## Overview

The Feedback Component provides a standardized way for AI agents to provide structured feedback to users, ensuring effective collaboration and continuous improvement.

## Core Features

1. **Structured Feedback Format**
   - Observation: What was observed
   - Analysis: Impact and root cause
   - Recommendation: Improvement suggestions
   - Questions: Clarification needs

2. **Feedback Categories**
   - Documentation Quality
   - Context Management
   - User Experience
   - Code Quality and Type Safety (NEW in v1.1.0)
   - Security and Compliance (NEW in v1.1.0)
   - Performance and Validation (NEW in v1.1.0)

3. **Implementation Guidelines**
   - Be specific and concrete
   - Focus on solutions
   - Provide clear next steps

## Usage

```python
def provide_feedback(observation, analysis, recommendation, questions):
    """
    Provide structured feedback following the framework.
    
    Args:
        observation (str): What was observed
        analysis (str): Impact and root cause
        recommendation (str): Improvement suggestions
        questions (list): List of clarification questions
    """
    feedback = {
        "observation": observation,
        "analysis": analysis,
        "recommendation": recommendation,
        "questions": questions
    }
    return feedback
```
