## Overview

The Git Workflow Component defines the standard practices for version control in the agent-doc-system project, including branch management, commit messages, and code review processes.

## Core Features

1. **Branch Strategy**
   - Main Branches:
     - `main`: Production-ready code
     - `develop`: Integration branch for features
   - Supporting Branches:
     - `feature/*`: New features
     - `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
     - `hotfix/*`: Urgent production fixes
     - `release/*`: Release preparation

2. **Commit Guidelines**
   - Format: `type(scope): description`
   - Types:
     - `feat`: New feature
     - `fix`: Bug fix
     - `docs`: Documentation
     - `style`: Formatting
     - `refactor`: Code restructuring
     - `test`: Testing
     - `chore`: Maintenance
   - Include ticket numbers
   - Write clear commit messages

3. **Workflow Process**
   1. Create feature branch from `develop`
   2. Develop and test locally
   3. Push changes and create PR
   4. Code review and approval
   5. Merge to `develop`
   6. Deploy to staging
   7. Merge to `main` for production

4. **Code Review Guidelines**
   - Review for functionality
   - Check code style
   - Verify tests
   - Ensure documentation
   - Validate against requirements

5. **Deployment Process**
   1. Merge to `develop`
   2. Run automated tests
   3. Deploy to staging
   4. Verify functionality
   5. Merge to `main`
   6. Deploy to production

## Usage

```bash
# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat(scope): add new feature [TICKET-123]"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

## Best Practices

1. Keep branches up to date
2. Write clear commit messages
3. Review code thoroughly
4. Test before merging
5. Document changes

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Merge Conflicts**
   - Update local branch
   - Resolve conflicts
   - Test changes

2. **Failed Deployments**
   - Check logs
   - Verify configuration
   - Rollback if needed

## Integration

The Git Workflow Component integrates with:
- Documentation Protocol
- Validation System
- CI/CD Pipeline
- Deployment Automation

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements:
- Automated testing
- CI/CD pipeline
- Branch protection
- Deployment automation
